## Overview

**CurioPay API** is the newly refactored backend REST API for the existing CurioPay financial management web application. It is designed to provide a secure, performant, and scalable service layer for user authentication, financial data management, expense tracking, and reporting.

This new backend improves upon the previous system by implementing modern security best practices, optimized database interactions, and a modular architecture to support future features such as AI-powered insights.

> **üöß Development Status**: This backend is currently under active development. I am working on implementing a comprehensive migration plan to seamlessly transition from the existing legacy backend to this new refactored system. The migration strategy includes data migration utilities, API compatibility layers, and gradual feature rollout to ensure zero downtime during the transition.

## Key Features

### üîê Security

- **JWT Authentication** with secure token management and expiration policies
- **OAuth Integration** supporting multiple providers (Google, GitHub)
- **Audit Logging** with RSA digital signature verification for integrity
- **Data Encryption** in transit and at rest
- **Rate Limiting** to mitigate brute force and DDoS attacks
- **Environment-Based Configuration** with strict validation to prevent misconfiguration
- **Comprehensive Input Validation** to prevent injection and other common attacks
- **CORS Protection** with configurable allowed origins

### ‚ö° Performance

- **Database Connection Pooling** for efficient queries
- **Performance Indexes** for optimized data retrieval
- **Efficient Data Processing** via optimized algorithms and data structures
- **Caching Strategies** to minimize database load and improve response times
- **Optimized Query Patterns** to reduce redundant operations

### üöÄ Planned Features

- **LLM Integration:** Enhance AI-powered insights and analytics
- **Comprehensive Automated Testing:** Improve test coverage and reliability
- **CI/CD with GitHub Workflows:** Automate builds, tests, and deployments
- **Detailed Mk-docs:** Documentation for the project
